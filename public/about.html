  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="big">I'm Taninwat. I've always been fascinated by the idea of currencies that can change the world, and that's what drew me to Bitcoin. 
      It represents a whole new way of thinking about money, and that excites me! 
      But my interests don't stop there. 
      I'm also passionate about the organized approach of project management, especially the Scrum Master role. 
      Plus, the world of investment always keeps me thinking and learning. 
      While my Bachelor's in Game Design and Project Management and Master's in Entrepreneurship gave me a solid foundation, I'm more than ready to dive deeper into the things that truly spark my curiosity.</p>

  <br>   
      
  <h2>Building a Diverse Educational Foundation</h2>    
    <p class="big">My education journey has been quite diverse. 
      I earned a Master's degree in Entrepreneurship, which equipped me with knowledge on how new ideas evolve into businesses. 
      This degree also sparked my interest in studying how entrepreneurs gain knowledge while working in business incubators. 
      Before this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Game Design. 
      During that time, I explored the motion sickness effects of virtual reality (VR) in a racing game and looked for ways to reduce discomfort for a better experience. 
      I also did quite a few game projects from board games to small video game projects and to larger game projects, taking on various roles like producer, project manager, scrum master, game designer, and game developer. 
      One thing I am certain about is my passion for learning. 
      Recently, I've started to learn front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to broaden my skills.</p>

  <h2>Beyond the Classroom: A Journey into Personal Finance</h2>    
    <p class="big">Additionally, I've always had a keen interest in personal finance, especially in learning about investment strategies. 
      My journey into understanding the complexities of the financial market began out of a desire to manage my own finances wisely. 
      Over the years, I've dedicated time to studying various investment methods, from stocks and bonds to cryptocurrencies. 
      This self-driven learning has not only empowered me to make informed financial decisions but also enriched my analytical skills, which I find invaluable in both my personal and professional life. 
      I believe that a solid foundation in financial literacy is crucial for success, and I continuously seek to expand my knowledge in this area.</p>

  <br>    

  <h2>Professional Growth: Real-World Experience and Challenges</h2>
    <p class="big">My journey into the professional world has been both challenging and exciting. 
      I started with an internship at Spreadly in Munich, which was an eye-opening experience. 
      There, I've applied what I've learned during my studies as well as learning a lot of new things about how companies grow and be competitive in the market. 
      It was fascinating to see business theories put into practice, and this experience taught me about the importance of adaptability and understanding global markets.</p>

  <br>
  
  <h2>Embracing Leadership: Operations Management and Continuous Learning</h2>
    <p class="big">Now, I'm working as the Operations Manager at Millennial Consulting in Copenhagen, a role I've taken on voluntarily. 
      My job involves looking after project management, improving how we work, and making sure projects are completed successfully. 
      It's a role that requires good organization, planning, and the ability to lead a team effectively. 
      I'm learning a lot and enjoying the chance to apply my skills in a real-world setting.</p>

    <p class="big">On top of my work, I'm also focused on learning as much as I can. 
      I'm currently taking a Google Project Management course to deepen my knowledge of managing projects successfully. 
      I'm also planning to take an IBM IT Scrum Master course and aim to get my Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) certification. 
      These steps are about more than just gaining new qualifications; they're about my commitment to becoming the best at what I do. 
      I believe that keeping up with new knowledge and skills is key to staying relevant in a fast-moving world. 
      My approach is all about pushing myself to learn and grow, so I can make a real difference in my career.</p>
